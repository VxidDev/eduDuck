        <h2>EduDuck Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights when using EduDuck AI study tools.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Account information: Username, email address, and securely hashed passwords (Werkzeug password hashing). OAuth user IDs if you sign in via Google, GitHub, Discord, or Microsoft.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Uploaded content: Notes, PDFs, or images temporarily processed using Tesseract OCR and PIL for generating quizzes, flashcards, study plans, and enhanced notes.</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Generated content: Quizzes, flashcards, study plans, enhanced notes, and note analyses stored in MongoDB with unique identifiers.</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Usage data: Daily usage counters (reset at midnight UTC), user IDs, and timestamps to enforce the 3 free uses per day limit.</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Cookies and browser storage: Session cookies (Flask-Login), CSRF tokens, theme preferences, and temporary session data for guest users.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Email verification tokens: Temporary tokens with 24-hour expiration sent via MailGun for account verification.</p>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> To provide AI study services via Hugging Face, Google Gemini, and OpenAI APIs.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> To authenticate users via session-based auth (Flask-Login) or OAuth (Authlib).</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> To track and enforce daily free-tier usage limits (3 uses per day).</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> To send verification emails via MailGun for password-based accounts.</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> To store and retrieve user-generated content (quizzes, flashcards, study plans, note analyses, duckai conversations , enhanced-notes) in MongoDB.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> To improve and maintain the security and functionality of our site.</p>

        <h3>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
        <p>For users in the EU and other regions with data protection laws, we process your data under the following bases:</p>
        <p><strong>•</strong> To fulfill our contract with you (providing AI study services).</p>
        <p><strong>•</strong> Under our legitimate interest to manage usage limits, prevent abuse, and maintain site functionality.</p>
        <p><strong>•</strong> With your consent for optional account features and OAuth authentication.</p>

        <h3>4. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Database: User data and generated content are stored in MongoDB Atlas with secure connections (certifi SSL verification).</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Uploaded files: PDFs and images are processed temporarily (usually within seconds) using pypdf and PIL, then discarded immediately after AI processing.</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Generated content: Stored indefinitely for logged-in users until manually deleted. Guest users' content is stored temporarily in session storage.</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Account deletion: Accounts marked for deletion are recoverable for 30 days. After 30 days, all associated data is permanently deleted from MongoDB.</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Email verification tokens: Automatically expire after 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>5. Cookies & Tracking</h3>
        <p>EduDuck uses minimal cookies and browser storage:</p>
        <p><strong>• Session cookies:</strong> Required for login authentication (Flask-Login) and CSRF protection.</p>
        <p><strong>• Theme preference cookies:</strong> To remember your light/dark mode choice.</p>
        <p><strong>• Session storage:</strong> Temporary storage of generated content for guest users (cleared when browser closes).</p>

        <p><strong>• AI Processing:</strong> Hugging Face Inference API, OpenAI API, and Google Gemini (2.5 Flash) process your uploaded content to generate study materials. Your data is sent temporarily via httpx (HTTP/2) and is not stored permanently by these services.</p>
        <p><strong>• OAuth Authentication:</strong> Authlib integrates with Google, GitHub, Discord, and Microsoft for secure sign-in. OAuth tokens are used only for authentication and not stored permanently.</p>
        <p><strong>• Email Services:</strong> MailGun sends verification emails for password-based accounts.</p>
        <p><strong>• Database Hosting:</strong> MongoDB Atlas (with certifi SSL) stores user accounts and generated content.</p>
